===Preface===
''&quot;Inspired by no earthly ambition, the Church seeks but a solitary goal: to carry forward the work of Christ under the lead of the befriending Spirit&quot; (3).''

===Introduction: The Situation of Men in the Modern World===
''&quot;The truth is that the imbalances under which the modern world labors are linked with that more basic imbalance which is rooted in the heart of man. For in man himself many elements wrestle with one another. Thus, on the one hand, as a creature he experiences his limitations in a multitude of ways; on the other he feels himself to be boundless in his desires and summoned to a higher life&quot; (10).''

      <text bytes="4224" xml:space="preserve">'''''Gaudium et Spes''''', the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, and was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 8]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is from the first sentence and means &quot;Joy and Hope&quot; in [[Latin]].  (The full text in English is available through the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Holy See's website].)

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]] for his part sat watching the proceedings on closed circuit televison. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this counicl was for.

It has been critisised as over-optomisitc, even from the floor of the council. It is said to play into the hands of the 'world' and the devil himself. Others say it is a typical response of the age of Aquarius, that the world is a darker place now, and it has lost its relevance. 

In [[2005]], this document celebrated 40 years. It was also the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openess in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]]) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

      <text bytes="4432" xml:space="preserve">'''''Gaudium et Spes''''', the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, and was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 8]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]] for his part sat watching the proceedings on closed circuit televison. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

==Criticism==

It has been critisised as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said to play into the hands of the 'world' and the devil himself. Others say it is a typical response of the age of Aquarius, that the world is a darker place now, and it has lost its relevance. 

In [[2005]], this document celebrated 40 years. It was also the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openess in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]]) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

==Criticism==

It has been criticised as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said to play into the hands of the 'world' and the devil himself. Others say it is a typical response of the age of Aquarius, that the world is a darker place now, and it has lost its relevance. 

In [[2005]], this document celebrated 40 years. It was also the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openness in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]]) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

It has been criticised as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said to play into the hands of the 'world' and the devil himself. Others say it is a typical response of the age of Aquarius, that the world is a darker place now, and it has lost its relevance. 

In [[2005]], this document celebrated 40 years. It was also the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openness in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then [Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]]) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]] for his part sat watching the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]] for his part sat watching the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

==Criticism==

It has been criticised as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said to play into the hands of the 'world' and the devil himself. Others say it is a typical response of the age of Aquarius, that the world is a darker place now, and it has lost its relevance. 

In [[2005]], this document celebrated 40 years. It was also the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openness in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]] for his part sat watching the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

==Criticism==

It has been criticised as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said to play into the hands of the 'world' and the devil himself.

In [[2005]], this document celebrated 40 years. It was also the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openness in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]] for his part sat watching the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

==Criticism==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said {{Fact|date=April 2008}}to play into the hands of the 'world' and the [[devil]] himself.

This document celebrated 40 years in [[2005]], the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others lead the commitment to a spirit of openness in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world that no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes. He praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

==Criticism==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said {{Fact|date=April 2008}}to play into the hands of the 'world' and the [[devil]] himself.

This document celebrated 40 years in [[2005]], the year [[Pope John Paul II]] died. He, more than others, lead the commitment to a spirit of openness in a [[secular]] world, traveling to many parts of the world to which no Pope had been before. The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?

In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “gay and pyronecrofeliatious.&quot;

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

==Criticism==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. It is said {{Fact|date=April 2008}}to play into the hands of the 'world' and the [[devil]] himself.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''', the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, and was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is from the first sentence and means &quot;Joy and Hope&quot; in [[Latin]].  (The full text in English is available through the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Holy See's website].)

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''', the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, and was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is from the first sentence and means &quot;Joy and Hope&quot; in [[Latin]].  (The full text in English is available through the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Holy See's website].)

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor. 

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council. 

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

As is customary with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is from the first sentence and means &quot;Joy and Hope&quot; in [[Latin]].  (The full text in English is available through the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Holy See's website].)

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''Lumen Gentium'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document that should be read by all.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''', the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, and was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is from the first sentence and means &quot;Joy and Hope&quot; in [[Latin]].  (The full text in English is available through the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Holy See's website].)

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. This document alone embodies the spirit that arose from the bishops, who for the first time saw people at the heart of the church. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. This council sought the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for. {{Fact|date=March 2009}}

### Setting Up an International Community (83-93)

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''', the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 73 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, and was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is from the first sentence and means &quot;Joy and Hope&quot; in [[Latin]].  (The full text in English is available through the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Holy See's website].)

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. The second Vatican council sought for the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for. {{Fact|date=March 2009}}

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence.  

__TOC__

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1870 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. The second Vatican council sought for the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for. {{Fact|date=March 2009}}

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence.  

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. The second Vatican council sought for the church to embrace this world and praised many of the good things in the world outside. One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of England urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months. He is said to have accepted that finally the fathers understood what this council was for. {{Fact|date=March 2009}}

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence.  

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. The primary purpose for Vatican II was to refresh the Church.  There are some who erroneously think that the Council's purpose was to embrace this world--they mistakently use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all the documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  Although he supposedly said that finally the fathers understood what this council was for, his reaction was long before the debate on Gaudium et Spes began.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence.  

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. The primary purpose for Vatican II was to refresh the Church.  There are some who erroneously think that the Council's purpose was to embrace this world--they mistakently use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all the documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  Although he is credited with saying that finally the fathers understood what this council was for, this reaction had nothing to do with Gaudium et Spes.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is a strong statement of the Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, and culture.

The memorable first lines read:
{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ. Indeed, nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their hearts.}} 

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence.  

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the chief accomplishments{{Fact|date=April 2008}} of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is a all-encompassing statement of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

The memorable first lines read:
{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ. Indeed, nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their hearts.}} 

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence.  

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence: 

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

#### Definition of Culture. Culture in its general sense indicates everything whereby man develops and perfects his many bodily and spiritual qualities; he strives by his knowledge and his labor, to bring the world itself under his control. He renders social life more human both in the family and the civic community, through improvement of customs and institutions.  Throughout the course of time he expresses, communicates and converses in his works, great spiritual experiences and desires that they might be of advantage to the progress of many, even the whole family (Guadium Et Spes Part II, Chapter II, Paragraph II).

The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document. ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' on the other hand is a dogmatic constitution document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on [[December 7]], [[1965]], the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence: 

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

My religion teacher is a lazy guy. The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

It has been criticized{{Fact|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

I think religion is a stupid subject, and my religion teacher is stupid too. Come on tephy you can do it!.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence: 

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

#### Definition of Culture. Culture in its general sense indicates everything whereby man develops and perfects his many bodily and spiritual qualities; he strives by his knowledge and his labor, to bring the world itself under his control. He renders social life more human both in the family and the civic community, through improvement of customs and institutions.  Throughout the course of time he expresses, communicates and converses in his works, great spiritual experiences and desires that they might be of advantage to the progress of many, even the whole family (Guadium Et Spes Part II, Chapter II, Paragraph II). 
### Some More Urgent Duties of Christians in Regard to Culture (60-62)

## The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations (77-93)
### The Avoidance of War (79-82)
### Setting Up an International Community (83-93)

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence: 

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Father Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence: 

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.  

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo John Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has made a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches.

== Criticism ==

It has been criticized{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} as over-optimistic, even from the floor of the council.

The ongoing question that arose from Gaudium et Spes is: how can the church be credible in a secular world?  In the commentaries of the document, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (then Father Joseph Ratzinger) called certain parts of Gaudium et Spes &quot;downright [[Pelagian]],&quot; particularly in the treatment of free will in article 17. He is not wholly negative in his judgment about Gaudium et Spes, however, and praises the discussion of atheism in articles 19-21 as “balanced and well-founded.”{{Citation needed|date=2010-6-22}}

''Gaudium et Spes'' is a pastoral document.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence:

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

He renders social life more human both in the family and the civic community, through improvement of customs and institutions.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence:

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-1875 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Josef Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;The joys and the hopes&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence:

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;The joys and the hopes&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 7, 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its first sentence:

{{cquote|The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{lang-la|&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;}}), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about man's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science &amp; technology, and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{quote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world.

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], who was deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], being deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], being deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et Spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], being deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use Gaudium et Spes as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] moom manes was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four [[Apostolic Constitution]]s resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{cquote|Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...}}

{{cquote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], being deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

{{Quote|text=''Gaudium et spes, luctus et angor hominum huius temporis, pauperum praesertim et quorumvis afflictorum, gaudium sunt et spes, luctus et angor etiam Christi discipulorum...''

The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], being deathly ill at the time, was forced to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.  One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], famed professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit]] in Latin:

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. [[Pope John XXIII]], deathly ill at the time, watched the proceedings on closed circuit television. He was too sick to attend, and died within months.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. 

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 Decemeber 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995 &lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''Lumen Gentium'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. &quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}}. This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869-70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 December 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''Lumen Gentium'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 December 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Contents ==
The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 December 1965] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411023509/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |date=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), LOVE KA NI LUKAS the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The document is an overview of the Catholic Church's teachings about humanity's relationship to society, especially in reference to economics, poverty, social justice, culture, science, technology and ecumenism.

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 December 1965] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411023509/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |date=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]]. OTEN

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 December 1965] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411023509/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |date=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=gaudium&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Gaudium et Spes'', §4, 7 December 1965] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411023509/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |date=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes, §43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Contents ==
The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[Ecumenical movement|ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council. The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council. The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Contents ==
The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[Ecumenical movement|ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{fact|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.

This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{fact|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler|Christopher Butle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡawdium et ˈspɛs|church}}, ''Joy and Hope''), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{fact|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler|Christopher Butle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[Ecumenical movement|ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{fact|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler|Christopher Butle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:
{{Quote|The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of Gaudium et Spes was on social teaching.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

The chief focus of [[Gaudium et Spes]] was on social teaching.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

== Overview ==

The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.

The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==


The Dogmatic Constitution was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

The previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world. Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents. One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=Rosica&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;


One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;


&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;
One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;


&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;


One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;


&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;



One of the cardinals, [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;


&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;


&quot;This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

      <comment>this is just incorrect. The main focus was not on social teaching. The document was the underpinning for what would become Catholic Social Teaching.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Summary of sections ===

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et Spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et Spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et Spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et Spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et Spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. . A Concise Guide to the Documents of Vatican II (Kindle Locations 1228-1231). St. Anthony Messenger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et Spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et Spes'' ===
''Gaudium et Spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et Spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et Spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et Spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et Spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et Spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et Spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et Spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et Spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

== Gift of Self ==
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weigel |first1=George |title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism |journal=First Things |issue=December 1999 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism |access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gift of Self ==

== Promotion of Peace ==
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964.

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Gift of Self ==

== Promotion of Peace ==

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Ecumenical impact ==
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central Themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as Gaudium et spes by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Gaudium et spes illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Gaudium et spes represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in Gaudium et spes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and Gaudium et Spes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
Gaudium et Spes has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin,|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plagued the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism.

## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Suenes to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenes revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenes was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text.

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21,1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[Bishop|bishops]] assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:43&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}} 

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt;In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Summary of sections ===

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Summary of sections ===

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', is one of the four constitutions among the 16 [[Magisterium|magisterial]] documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The Latin title ''Gaudium et spes'' (&quot;The joys and hopes&quot;) is taken from the document's opening sentence: &quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;

The final text was approved on 6 December 1965 by a vote of 2,111 to 25. It became the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern Morld''' the next day (7 December 1965) when it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]], after another vote, this time of 2,307 in favour and 75 opposed.&lt;ref&gt;John W. O&quot;Malley, ''What Happened at Vatican II'', Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Summary of sections ===

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', is one of the four constitutions among the 16 [[Magisterium|magisterial]] documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The Latin title ''Gaudium et spes'' (&quot;The joys and hopes&quot;) is taken from the document's opening sentence: &quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;

The final text was approved on 6 December 1965 by a vote of 2,111 to 25. It became the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern Morld''' the next day (7 December 1965) when it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]], after another vote, this time of 2,307 in favour and 75 opposed.&lt;ref&gt;John W. O&quot;Malley, ''What Happened at Vatican II'', Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Summary of sections ===

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Summary of sections ===

# '''Preface'''
## The Preface seeks to illustrate the relationship the Church has with the world and what it should represent moving into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; It shows the Church is willing to embrace people all around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;   The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;{{Quote|&quot;The joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well.&quot;|author=|title=|source=}}
# '''Introduction'''
## The introductory paragraphs calls for the church to take account of the problems that the world faces in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It suggests areas of concern for the church to tackle, some of which are addressed in Part 2 of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 1: The Church and Man's Calling'''
## Part 1 opens with the creation of man in the light of God and the dignity to which man possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; It then discusses the mission of the church in the world by acknowledging other churches outside of the Roman Catholic church and their mutual relationship with the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Due to this, the church acknowledges it can learn much about the world from other churches and must be present in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; Being present in the world is accomplished through taking accountability for problems affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Part 2: Some Problems of Special Urgency'''
## Part 2 directly addresses problems in the world that the council thought were especially important to address.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; These problems include: marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt; The problems were selected as those that currently affect the world and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;
# '''Conclusion'''
## The conclusion reiterates the commitment of the church to communicate with the people of the world rather than just the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot; /&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Gift of self ===
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

=== Promotion of peace ===
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Contents ==

=== Central themes ===

==== Gift of self ====
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

==== Promotion of peace ====
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;/&gt; It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Ecumenical Impact ===
The document contributed to the [[ecumenical movement]] of its time and has had a huge influence on the social teachings of the wider Christian churches and communities, especially the churches that belong to the [[World Council of Churches]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', was one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1965. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Contents ==

=== Central themes ===

==== Gift of self ====
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

==== Promotion of peace ====
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''. According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world. It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Contents ==

=== Central themes ===

==== Gift of self ====
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

==== Promotion of peace ====
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''. According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world. It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50| title = Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

=== Central themes ===

==== Gift of self ====
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

==== Promotion of peace ====
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''. According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world. It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', is one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1965. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, [[Lumen Gentium]] (LG), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', is one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1965. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaillardetz, Richard R., 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|others=Clifford, Catherine E., 1958-|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|others=Brigham, Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, [[Lumen Gentium|the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church]] (LG) and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

'''''Gaudium et spes''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡau̯di.um et ˈspes|church}}, &quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), the '''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World''', is one of the four constitutions resulting from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1965. It was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by an ecumenical council to address the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Joseph|date=2010|title=Theological Anthropology of &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; and Fundamental theology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44322673|journal=Gregorianum|volume=91|issue=1|pages=124–136|jstor=44322673|issn=0017-4114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' clarified and reoriented the role of the church’s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gaillardetz|first1=Richard R.|last2=Clifford|first2=Catherine E.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793345332|title=Keys to the Council : unlocking the teaching of Vatican II|date=2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-3424-0|location=Collegeville, Minn.|oclc=793345332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The constitution's creation was necessitated by fear of the church’s irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world (see [[Modernity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Pope John XXIII]] began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902830768|title=The church in the modern world : fifty years after Gaudium et spes|last1=Brigham|first1=Erin|isbn=0-7391-8731-7|location=Lanham, MD|oclc=902830768}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated with the creation of ''Gaudium et spes'' to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During the creation of the document itself, ''Gaudium et spes'' went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; After long debate during the council over ''Gaudium et spes'', the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the church and its interactions with the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Sean O.|date=2011|title=Gaudium Et Spes: The Development and Implementation of the Church's Role in Evangelization in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585087/summary|journal=The Jurist: Studies in Church Law and Ministry|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=91–119|doi=10.1353/jur.2011.0013|s2cid=192678881|issn=2326-6236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Gaudium et spes'' are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of ''Gaudium et spes'' today marks the document as a turning point in the Church’s focus on the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=George|title=John Paul II and the Crisis of Humanism|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1999/12/john-paul-ii-and-the-crisis-of-humanism|journal=First Things|issue=December 1999|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, [[Lumen Gentium|the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church]] (LG) and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (GS) stand as the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.{{why|date=January 2019}}{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Dogmatic Constitution treats the nature of the church in itself; the Pastoral Constitution treats its mission in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnenberg, Edward P. .

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, it was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.  As is customary with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents, the title is taken from its [[incipit|opening words]] in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaudium et spes|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on October 11, 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] celebrated the opening Mass of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; During which, Pope John indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; Such issues included the devastation of [[World War II]], Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted [[First Vatican Council]] and the need for reform within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, [[Gaudet Mater Ecclesia]], Pope John XIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; He wanted the council to focus on “the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius,” while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the “joys and the hopes” of the entire world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt;

=== The creation of the text of ''Gaudium et spes'' ===
''Gaudium et spes'' was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; This led to Pope John asking Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Leo Jozef Suenens]] to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: “Ad intra,” internally, and “ad extra,” externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; These ultimately resulted in [[Lumen gentium|Lumen Gentium]] and ''Gaudium et spes'', respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt; Schema 12, while focusing on the church’s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become ''Gaudium et spes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt; Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops’ suggestions were aggregated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;:33&quot; /&gt;  Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the [[bishop]]s assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as ''Gaudium et spes'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, ''Gaudium et spes'', was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council's effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;:022&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the previous [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on updating the role of the Church in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; Those who interpret the purpose of the Second Council as one of embracing this world use ''Gaudium et spes'' as the primary hermeneutic for all its documents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Gaudium et spes'' was adopted after ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'', the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Norman. ''The Church and the Modern World'', Paulist Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; ''Gaudium et spes'' illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Bishop [[Christopher Butler]] points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church was Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all, and in charity we must presume that those who differ from us are nevertheless people of good will'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bishop Christopher Butler writes|url=http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, ''Gaudium et spes'' represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;/&gt;

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of Belgium, urged the council to take on social responsibility for Third World suffering, International peace and war, and the poor, sentiments echoed by [[Pope Paul VI|Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini]] of Milan and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629181950/https://zenit.org/articles/gaudium-et-spes-at-50 Rosica CSB, Thomas. &quot;Gaudium et Spes at 50&quot;, ''Zenit'', 20 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Thomas Rosica]] points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosica&quot; /&gt; In the Introduction it states, &quot;... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§4}}

[[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], professor of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] was influential in the composition of ''Gaudium et spes'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Principe, &quot;Chenu, M.D&quot; in Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Edited by Richard McBrien, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Louis-Joseph Lebret]]. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in ''Gaudium et spes''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosica/&gt; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.&quot;.{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Contents ==

=== Central themes ===

==== Gift of self ====
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§24. &quot;...man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.&quot;}} was a phrase used often by [[Pope John Paul II]] and particularly in his [[Theology of the Body]].  This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;

==== Promotion of peace ====
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;.  This chapter echoed themes declared near the start of Vatican II by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1963 in his well-regarded encyclical, [[Pacem in Terris]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and ''Gaudium et spes''. According to [[Henri de Lubac]], the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Project MUSE - The Church in the Modern World|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46645|access-date=2020-12-14|website=muse.jhu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception today ===
''Gaudium et spes'' has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world. It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church’s message to the world today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;
