      <text bytes="1651" xml:space="preserve">'''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''' is an essay by [[Eric Raymond]] published in May [[1997]] about the nature of [[open source]] [[computer programming]] projects. The title describes two opposing views of [[software engineering|software development]]: the ''Cathedral'', or [[closed source]], where access to software source code is tightly restricted, as if the code were holy, and the ''Bazaar'', or [[open source]], where the code is widely distributed for all to see and correct. The essay is considered by many as contributing to a sea change in attitudes to software development in the closing years of the [[20th century]].

One of the central concepts is perhaps best expressed by Raymond's proposition that ''Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'', meaning that if many people examine program code, bugs are discovered. This contrasts with the [[closed source]] development method used by commercial developers, where few people see the code, and bugs do not get detected. Many people see [[Microsoft Corporation]] as the epitome of the closed source model, with all it's attendant reduction in software quality.

The essay is credited with persuading [[Netscape Corporation]] to make the source code of its [[Netscape]] [[web browser]] available for open source development in the [[Mozilla]] project. The essay made a significant contribution to helping programmers understand why open source was a ''Very Good Thing'', and why they should contribute to it rather than viewing all software development as a money-making exercise.

The title describes two different models of [[software engineering|software development]]:

*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which access to software source code is restricted to members of the development team. Raymond used [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] (prior to version 21) as an example: although the [[source code]] was provided to the public with each release of the software, the code being developed between releases was restricted to a small group of core developers. This is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]], with the additional restriction that source code is not provided even during releases.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credited [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provided anecdotal accounts of his successful implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The central argument in the essay is Raymond's proposition that ''Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'': if the source code is available for the public to peruse, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay is credited with persuading [[Netscape Corporation]] to make the source code of its [[Netscape]] [[web browser]] available for open source development in the [[Mozilla]] project. The essay also helped to convince most existing [[open source]] and [[free software]] projects to adopt &quot;Bazaar&quot;-style open development models.

      <text bytes="2005" xml:space="preserve">'''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''' is an essay by [[Eric Raymond]] on [[open source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his experience managing a successful open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]].

The essay contrasts two different development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which access to software source code is restricted to members of the development team. Raymond used [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] (prior to version 21) as an example: although the [[source code]] was provided to the public with each release of the software, the code being developed between releases was restricted to a small group of core developers. This is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]], with the additional restriction that source code is not provided even during releases.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credited [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provided anecdotal accounts of his successful implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The central argument in the essay is Raymond's proposition that ''Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow''([[Linus's Law]]): if the source code is available for the public to peruse, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay also helped to convince most existing [[open source]] and [[free software]] projects to adopt &quot;Bazaar&quot;-style open development models.

In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay also helped to convince most existing [[open source]] and [[free software]] projects to adopt &quot;Bazaar&quot;-style open development models.

==Term extended==

The term itself has been extended to include non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is an example of a bazaar-type project, while [[Nupedia]] or the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are examples of a cathedral-like project.

'''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''' is an essay by [[Eric Raymond]] on [[open source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his experience managing a successful open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]].

The essay contrasts two different development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which access to software [[source code]] is restricted to members of the development team. Raymond used [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] (prior to version 21) and [[GCC]] (prior to the [[EGCS]] re-merge) as examples: although the [[source code]] was provided to the public with each release of the software, the code being developed between releases was restricted to a small and exclusive group of core [[developer]]s. This is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]], with the additional restriction that source code is not provided even during releases.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credited [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provided anecdotal accounts of his successful implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central argument is Raymond's proposition that ''Given enough [[eyeball]]s, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow'' ([[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for the public to peruse, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate.

'''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''' (paperback: ISBN 0596001088) is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[open source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his experience managing a successful open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]]  development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which access to software [[source code]] is restricted to members of the development team. Raymond used [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] (prior to version 21) and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (prior to the [[EGCS]] re-merge) as examples: although the [[source code]] was available with each release of the software, code developed between releases was restricted to a small and exclusive group of core [[developer]]s.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credited [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provided anecdotal accounts of his successful implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (termed [[Linus's law]] by Raymond): if the source code is available for the public to peruse, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing [[open source]] and [[free software]] projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, at least partially. It also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to open the source of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with [[free software]], and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

'''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[open source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his experience managing a successful open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]]  development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which access to software [[source code]] is restricted to members of the development team. Raymond used [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] (prior to version 21) and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (prior to the [[EGCS]] re-merge) as examples: although the [[source code]] was available with each release of the software, code developed between releases was restricted to a small and exclusive group of core [[developer]]s.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credited [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provided anecdotal accounts of his successful implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (termed [[Linus's law]] by Raymond): if the source code is available for the public to peruse, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing [[open source]] and [[free software]] projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, at least partially. It also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to open the source of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with [[free software]], and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

*[http://www.ora.de/catalog/cb/chapter/ The Magic Cauldron], 1999 - It is a very good read on the reality of free software development. It still applies and it's nice to see that the even the optimistic IDG projections are today surpassed by far.

      <text bytes="3358" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[open source|open-source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his experience managing a successful open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]]  development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which access to software [[source code]] is restricted to members of the development team. Raymond used [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] (prior to version 21) and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (prior to the [[EGCS]] re-merge) as examples: although the [[source code]] was available with each release of the software, code developed between releases was restricted to a small and exclusive group of core [[developer]]s.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credited [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provided anecdotal accounts of his successful implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (termed [[Linus's law]] by Raymond): if the source code is available for the public to peruse, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing [[open source]] and [[free software]] projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, at least partially. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to open the source of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source.

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples (in 1999, both projects switched to the bazaar model).  Raymonds' choice of examples, however, may have been influenced by a desire to present [[Richard Stallman]] as out-dated.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]] as the inventor of this process, through the [[Linux]] kernel project. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public scrutiny, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

      <text bytes="3721" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[open source|open-source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny and experimentation, bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The software projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral style development, Emacs and GCC, were both GNU projects.  Both were also written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept all of his code.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

      <text bytes="4432" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[open source|open-source]] [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects. 

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

      <text bytes="5273" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an open source project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source]] [[open source movement|movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects. 

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source. However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects. 

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

      <text bytes="5151" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source]] [[open source movement|movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate.

It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source]] [[open source movement|movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects. 

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

      <text bytes="5580" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]].  It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source]] [[open source movement|movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects. 

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s.  [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects. 

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

      <text bytes="5784" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source]] [[open source movement|movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Paperback edition book cover]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that '''Given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bug]]s are shallow''' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="5912" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source]] [[open source movement|movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way at all.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="5918" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples.

      <text bytes="6114" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="6091" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="6165" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as the [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[developer]]s. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="6298" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer|developers]]. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="6445" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer|developers]]. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. He also provides anecdotal accounts of his implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

      <text bytes="6493" xml:space="preserve">'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]], [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in [[1999]]. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

[[Image:Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-book-cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the paperback revised edition of the book including this and other essays by Raymond]]

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:
*The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer|developers]]. [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
*The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[Computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): if the source code is available for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, then bugs will be discovered at a rapid rate. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] to [[open-sourcing|open the source]] of [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.

&lt;!--see talk: the cited arguments aren't substantiated and look like original research:  The projects that Raymond used as examples of Cathedral-style development, Emacs and GCC, were both [[GNU]] projects, written primarily by [[Richard Stallman]], a man with whom Raymond had many heated arguments (&quot;Free Software&quot; Vs. &quot;Open Source&quot; etc.).  Raymond was a contributor to Emacs at one time, although the core Emacs developers would not accept most of his code.--&gt;
The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

The terminology has been extended to describe non-software projects. [[Wikipedia]] is a Bazaar-style project, while [[Nupedia]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] are Cathedral-style projects.{{fact}}

When [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project. &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project. &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]).

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[open source movement]].

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project. &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under an [[Open Publication License|open source document license]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. It is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of the [[Open Source Initiative]].

== Content ==

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

== Legacy ==

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project. &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral is also the typical development model for [[proprietary software]] &amp;mdash; with the additional restriction in that case that source code is usually not provided even with releases &amp;mdash; and a common usage of the phrase ''&quot;the Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;'' is to contrast proprietary with open source (Raymond has used it this way himself, ''e.g.'' in the [[Halloween Documents]]). However, the original essay concerns itself only with free software, and does not address proprietary development in any way.

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

CatB is commonly regarded as a [[manifesto]] of sorts to the [[free and open source software]] development model.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

== Content ==

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus' law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

== Legacy ==

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

== Content ==

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

== Legacy ==

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

== Content ==

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

== Legacy ==

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S.

There are 19 steps to creating good open source software listed in his essay
1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. ``Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.'' 
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
11. The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12. Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
13. ``Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.''
14. Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15. When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
16. When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17. A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18. To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
19: Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on [[May 27]] [[1997]] in Würzburg and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

== Content ==

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in Würzburg and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

== Content ==

The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 steps to creating good open source software listed in his essay:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 steps to creating good open source software listed in his essay:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S.

In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 steps to creating good open source software listed in his essay:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.&lt;/li&gt;

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in Würzburg and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 steps to creating good open source software listed in his essay:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it achieved another distinction by being the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in Würzburg and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the fetchmail project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in Würzburg and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that ''&quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot;'' (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] In addition to listening to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially &amp;mdash; including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Guidelines for creating good open source software==
There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Guidelines for creating good open source software==

{{Ref improve section|date=November 2011}}

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederich Brooks' [[The Mythical Man Month]])
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Guidelines for creating good open source software==

{{Ref improve section|date=November 2011}}

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederich Brooks' [[The Mythical Man Month]])
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]].

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S.

Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Guidelines for creating good open source software==

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' [[The Mythical Man Month]])
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

[[Marshall Poe]], in his essay &quot;The Hive&quot;, likens [[Wikipedia]] to the Bazaar model that Raymond defines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Hive |publisher=The Atlantic |first=Marshall |last=Poe |month=September |year=2006 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/5118/ |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Guidelines for creating good open source software==

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' [[The Mythical Man Month]])
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

[[Marshall Poe]], in his essay &quot;The Hive&quot;, likens [[Wikipedia]] to the Bazaar model that Raymond defines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Hive |publisher=The Atlantic |first=Marshall |last=Poe |month=September |year=2006 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/5118/ |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

[[Marshall Poe]], in his essay &quot;The Hive&quot;, likens [[Wikipedia]] to the Bazaar model that Raymond defines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Hive |publisher=The Atlantic |first=Marshall |last=Poe |month=September |year=2006 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/5118/ |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus' Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Guidelines for creating good open source software==

There are 19 guidelines for creating good open source software listed in his essay:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]].

[[Marshall Poe]], in his essay &quot;The Hive&quot;, likens [[Wikipedia]] to the Bazaar model that Raymond defines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Hive |publisher=The Atlantic |first=Marshall |last=Poe |month=September |year=2006 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/5118/ |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. It was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of a book of the same name in 1999.

==Content==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy==
The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples. Most famously, in 1998 it also provided the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]]. The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Poe]], in his essay &quot;The Hive&quot;, likens [[Wikipedia]] to the Bazaar model that Raymond defines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Hive |publisher=The Atlantic |first=Marshall |last=Poe |date=September 2006 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/5118/ |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).

#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.

#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.

#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).

#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.

#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The essay helped convince most existing open source and free software projects to adopt Bazaar-style open development models{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}, fully or partially—including GNU Emacs and GCC, the original Cathedral examples{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Most famously, in 1998 it also helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

If you've ever tried to promote a proposal within your organization, then you may have discovered that it's somewhat easier to do this if you can point to someone outside the organization who's saying the same thing.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape's public recognition of this influence made Raymond into a &quot;hacker celebrity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Williams|title=Free as in Freedom &amp;#91;Paperback&amp;#93;: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BB68Ql7ZY_AC&amp;pg=PA161|date=30 November 2011|publisher=&quot;O'Reilly Media, Inc.&quot;|isbn=978-1-4493-2464-3|pages=161|quote=When Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale cited Raymond's 'Cathedral and the Bazaar' essay as a major influence upon the company's decision, the company instantly elevated Raymond to the level of haker celebrity.

When [[O'Reilly Media]] published the book in 1999, it became the first complete and commercially distributed book published under the [[Open Publication License]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] are presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples (though both projects now have world-readable [[source code repositories]]).
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'')
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.

#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#[[Release early, release often|Release early. Release often.]] And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management. In my opinion the paper's importance in the context of Netscape's decision was mainly that it provided some independent validation of ideas that were already being actively discussed and promoted within Netscape. If you've ever tried to promote a proposal within your organization, then you may have discovered that it's somewhat easier to do this if you can point to someone outside the organization who's saying the same thing.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape's public recognition of this influence brought Raymond renown in hacker culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Williams|title=Free as in Freedom &amp;#91;Paperback&amp;#93;: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BB68Ql7ZY_AC&amp;pg=PA161|date=30 November 2011|publisher=&quot;O'Reilly Media, Inc.&quot;|isbn=978-1-4493-2464-3|pages=161|quote=When Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale cited Raymond's 'Cathedral and the Bazaar' essay as a major influence upon the company's decision, the company instantly elevated Raymond to the level of hacker celebrity.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).

#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.

#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]])
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your language is nowhere near [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]], [[syntactic sugar]] can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the source code for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''CatB''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated ''''CatB'''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This applies to the *essay*: --&gt;
&lt;!-- followed_by = [[Homesteading the Noosphere]] --&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's Law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla|author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html|quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 around 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla |author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823 |quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management. |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla |author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823 |quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management. |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the same{{nbhyph}}titled book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|access-date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|access-date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla |author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823 |quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management. |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the same{{nbhyph}}titled book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|access-date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''Cathedral'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''Bazaar'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|access-date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla |author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823 |quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management. |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the same{{nbhyph}}titled book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|access-date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ cathedral-bazaar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|access-date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla |author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823 |quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management. |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.

'''''The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary''''' (abbreviated '''''CatB''''') is an essay, and later a book, by [[Eric S. Raymond]] on [[software engineering]] methods, based on his observations of the [[Linux kernel]] development process and his experiences managing an [[Open-source model|open source]] project, [[fetchmail]]. It examines the struggle between [[top-down and bottom-up design]]. The essay was first presented by the author at the [[Linux Kongress]] on May 27, 1997 in [[Würzburg]] (Germany) and was published as part of the same{{nbhyph}}titled book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by [[Liubov Popova#Development of style: Cubo-Futurism|Liubov Popova]] titled ''Composition with Figures'' and belongs to the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;o'reilly website listing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colophon|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do|work=The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar|publisher=O'Reily Media|access-date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was released under the [[Open Publication License]] v2.0 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;opl&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030424100429/http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/| title = cathedral-bazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;==
The essay contrasts two different [[free software]] development models:

* The ''[[Cathedral]]'' model, in which [[source code]] is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of [[software developer]]s. [[GNU Emacs]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] were presented as examples.
* The ''[[Bazaar]]'' model, in which the code is developed over the [[Internet]] in view of the public. Raymond credits [[Linus Torvalds]], leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the [[Fetchmail]] project.

The essay's central thesis is Raymond's proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all [[computer bug|bugs]] are shallow&quot; (which he terms [[Linus's law]]): [[Marketplace of ideas|the more widely available]] the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric Steven|title=The Cathedral and the Bazaar|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html|access-date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the essay helped the final push for [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release the [[source code]] for [[Netscape Communicator]] and start the [[Mozilla]] project; it was cited by [[Frank Hecker]] and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |chapter= Freeing the Source: The Story of Mozilla |author= Jim Hamerly and Tom Paquin with Susan Walton |edition= 1st |date= January 1999 |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823 |quote= Frank had done his homework, citing Eric Raymond's paper, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar,&quot; and talking to people in departments throughout the organization--from engineering to marketing to management. |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Interview: Frank Hecker |author= Louis Suárez-Potts |date= 1 May 2001 |publisher= openoffice.org |url= http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html |quote= (Since it always gets mentioned in relation to Netscape's Mozilla decision, I should also note that Eric Raymond's paper &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; was referenced by me and others who were lobbying Netscape's management.
